I'm Rodrigo Caldeira de Melo, a brazilian developer from Vitória - Espírito Santo.

I'm finishing my graduation at Computer Science by UFES (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo),
and my graduation project is about the usage of smart contracts at online public auction. I'm trying
to develop a smart contract that could be used instead of current platform, increasing the transparency
of auction allied with the persistence of Blockchain. As a graduation project, I'll assume
that the infrastructure already is available and running and my Smart Contract will run above it.

Besides my main purpose of creating the blog (as you can read above), I'll post some related stuff
with blockchain tecnology while I'm studing it and probably also example smart contract with the
explanation of what was the thinking behind the lines of code.

My background knowledge on coding starts at mIRC Scripting when I was 14 years old - I miss that.
While in graduation I formally study Haskell, C, Python, Java, SQL. As intern I had to learn PHP,
HTML, JavaScript, MySQL and PostgreSQL. Now with my graduation project,
I'm learning, besides Solidity, ReactJS - for dApps development.

I'm also an enthuasiast of stock market, and someday I expect to have the time to study and implement some
artificial inteligence stuff.
